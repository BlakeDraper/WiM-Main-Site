                            <p>Aaron Stephenson is a full stack developer and solutions architect at WiM, but essentially he is their jack-of-all-trades. He has a decade of experience in system administration, database administration, information management, systems analysis, as well as back end and front end development, almost all of which have been in support of GIS data, services, and applications. Currently, most of his time is engaged in supporting WIM's migration to a service-oriented architecture and cloud computing. In his free time, Aaron loves reading, getting outdoors to hike and canoe, and attempting to become a decent cook.</p>
